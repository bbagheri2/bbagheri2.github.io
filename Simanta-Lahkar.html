        <h3>Dr. Behnaz Bagheri - The Principal Investigator</h3>
        <p class="description">Behnaz Bagheri is an assistant professor in the Applied Physics department at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). She has expertise in multiscale modelling of electronic excitations in soft matter with the focus on polymeric systems, and in multiscale modelling of electric gas discharges. Her current research focus lies at the intersection of soft matter and plasma, where she investigates the interaction of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasmas with biological surfaces. Bagheri employs techniques from computational quantum chemistry, classical molecular dynamics and fluid-type models in her research. Her research has applications in medicine, agriculture and public health.</p>
